The database is using a consistent naming scheme, explained here (all ranges
are inclusive):

  * pad: die bonding site, corresponds to different pins (or none at all)
    depending on the package.
  * R: global reset pad.
  * C<n>: global clock input <n> pad, <n> is 1..2; this is the physical pad,
    distinct from the internal GCLK<n> net. (There is no pad C3 because GCLK3
    is connected to a macrocell pad.)
  * E<n>: global OE input <n> pad, <n> is 1..2; this is the physical pad,
    distinct from the internal GOE<n> net.
  * M<n>: macrocell <n> IO pad, <n> is 1..32/64/etc.
  * GCLK<n>: global clock net, <n> is 1..3; always connected to pads C1, C2,
    and a specific macrocell pad depending on device.
  * GCLR: global reset net; always connected to pad R.
  * GOE<n>: global OE net, <n> is 1..6; multiplexed.
  * PT<p>: product term <p>, <p> is 1..5.
  * MC<m>: macrocell <m>, <m> is 1..32/64/etc.
  * MC<m>_PT<p>: product term <p> of macrocell <m>; this fully specifies
    a particular product term on die.
  * MC<m>_{ST,XT,AS,AR,CE,CLK,D,Q,I,O,OE}: macrocell sum term (ST), exclusive
    or term (XT), asynchronous set net (AS), asynchronous reset net (AR), clock
    enable net (CE), clock net (CLK), flip-flop input net (D), flip-flop output
    net (Q), pin buffer input net (I), pin buffer output net (O), pin buffer
    output enable net (OE) respectively.
  * MC<m>_{FB,FLB}: macrocell feedback (FB) and foldback (FLB) nets
    respectively.

The naming scheme for global inputs and nets does NOT match the datasheet
because the datasheet is extremely confusing. For example it calls global
clock inputs "GCLK1..3", global clock nets "GCK0..2", and the numbers do not
even have the same order. Similarly, it calls global reset input "GCLR",
global reset net "GCLEAR", their polarity may not match, and both are routed
throughout the device.
